SSHTunnels
==========


Introduction
------------

A pair of programs to babysit both ends of an SSH tunnel. The client side can be roaming from network to network and/or on an unreliable link and it will do its best to keep the tunnel up as often as possible for as long as possible. The server side will promptly clean up stale connections to free up ports in preparation for an incoming client connection.
